# A PHP Client for Harvest API

[Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) is a time tracking and invoicing tool.

This PHP SDK is generated automatically with [JanePHP](https://github.com/janephp/janephp) using a [Harvest OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/jolicode/harvest-openapi-generator/) generated from the HTML documentation.


## Installation

This library is built atop of [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) and
[PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/). So you will need to install some
implementations for those interfaces.

If no PSR-18 client or PSR-7 message factory is available yet in your project
or you don't know or don't care which one to use, just install some default:

```bash
composer require symfony/http-client nyholm/psr7
```

You can now install the Harvest client:

```bash
composer require jolicode/harvest-php-api
```

## Usage

First, you need to retrieve an access token. Please checkout Harvest's documentation about the [OAuth2 Authorization Flow](https://help.getharvest.com/api-v2/authentication-api/authentication/authentication/#for-server-side-applications).

Then, use the factory that is provided to create the client:

```php
// $client contains all the methods to interact with the API
$client = JoliCode\Harvest\ClientFactory::create(
  $accessToken,
  $harvestAccountId
);

$clients = $client->listClients([
  'is_active' => true,
])->getClients();

dump($clients);
```
